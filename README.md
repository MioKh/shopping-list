# Shopping List Project

Trying to build something fully on my own.

So, most of the stuff on my GitHub are project assignments from various courses. This time, I'll be creating something entirely on my own, though I'll get the design from somewhere else.

## Plan

This is my plan for now:

- [x] **Layout** : Making the initial layout.
- [x] **Add Items**: Allow users to add items to the list.
- [x] **Remove Items**: Implement a button to remove items from the list.
- [x] **Clear List**: Provide a function to clear the entire list at once.
- [x] **Filter Items**: Enable users to search and filter items using a search bar.
- [x] **Local Storage**: Implemented basic local storage for persistent data.
- [x] **Edit Mode**: Allow users to enter an edit mode to modify items.
- [x] **Update Items**: Provide functionality to update item details.
- [x] **Prevent Duplicates**: Prevent duplicate items from being added to the list.
  Ok so a quick edit i thought of some very good ideas that would actually be useful to me like daily to weekly
- [x] **Check button** : Adding a button to mark items as purchased (strikethrough text).
- [] **Unit Selection** : Allowing users to choose between units like kilograms and pieces (potentially expanding to other units later).
- [] **Price input** : Enabling users to input the price of each item.
- [] **Initial Money** : Allowing users to enter an initial amount of money and automatically calculate the total spent, updating the remaining balance.
- _// Maybe I'll get some more ideas._
