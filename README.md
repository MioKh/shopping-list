# Shopping List Project

Trying to build something fully on my own.

So, most of the stuff on my GitHub are project assignments from various courses. This time, I'll be creating something entirely on my own, though I'll get the design from somewhere else.

## Plan

This is my plan for now:

- [x] **Layout** : Making the initial layout.
- [] **Add Items**: Allow users to add items to the list.
- [] **Remove Items**: Implement a button to remove items from the list.
- [] **Clear List**: Provide a function to clear the entire list at once.
- [] **Filter Items**: Enable users to search and filter items using a search bar.
- [] **Local Storage**: Implement local storage to store data persistently.
- [] **Edit Mode**: Allow users to enter an edit mode to modify items.
- [] **Update Items**: Provide functionality to update item details.
- *// Maybe I'll get some more ideas.*
